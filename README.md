### Purpose

#### Outlining the problem
Problem:
Writers of many kinds use pen and paper notebooks, which are highly portable, to jot ideas, make entries and do short activities in any writing environment they choose, but they then have the problem of storing or retrieving those ideas IF they choose to re-use them or develop them at another time. 

Solution: Use a creative writing app.

Problem: There are a bunch of apps that don't provide this. 


#### The creative writing app landscape

There are a lot of creative writing apps around, each falling into roughly three groups. Firstly, there is general writing software that provides word and document processing and is often searchable e.g. simply Notes on iOS, or those also embedded within goal/project oriented features e.g. Notion.
Then there are apps that are specifically for creative writing but provide highly scaffolded steps, and even courses, to support a writer towards and through a larger project like a manuscript/screenplay e.g. Scrivener, Werdsmith, Writerly etc. Finally, there are short prompting apps e.g. brainsparker, wordpalette, dailyPrompt, and jumpwrite. 

Each prompting app has a different solution for providing the prompt content. Brainsparker has very general brainstorming flashcards with no text editor for input and the card content is only sometimes applicable to creative writing. Word palette allows a user to define their preferred text and content types then generate a random word salad extracted from that textual tone, then input their own response. DailyPrompt is interactive and allows users to make a social profile and write their own prompt activities for all to use, according to category. 

Jumpwrite has the most similar solution to the scope of this app, with a random word generator prompt, a random image generator prompt from APIs, however it has no backend for users to save their input.

### 

Solution: This app. This is a creative writing app that is simple, direct, distraction-free, has a prompt option, and allows the writer to save and search their entries. The aim is an app that has the portability and simplicity of a notebook and pen in your jacket pocket, but the storage capacity of your home bookshelf, searchability of your laptop and convenience and stimulation of an in-built activity prompter. 


Creative writers tend to complete short exercises out and about, changing location or choosing a favourtite cafe, writing in notebook after notebook. This can make it hard to find and reuse ideas, character profiles, prose snippets that might be reused in a larger structures piece.

### Functionality / features

The user will be able to
log in
to write a note
to write a response to a prompt
to store a prompt of their own??
to store a photo of their own? - like an inspiration board??
to write a character
to write a scene
to save each post in their login


### Target audience

the target audience is for working creative writers who use e-devices for writing exercise or storing ideas. Additionally the target audience is creative writers who are not professional writers but enjoy writing. The app can be used by creative writers of any age. 

The app does have some level of secure log in but may not be suitable for writers writing a family history to store sensitive data.

### User Profile # 1
### Penny Jotterman: the hobby creative writer. 

- Penny writes creatively for enjoyment and writes comfortably and regularly. 
- She's not looking for her inner creative to be unlocked by a course, but she does use activities and tools as she prefers as part of her own practice. 
- What she writes is diverse: sometimes she works on structured or competition pieces, sometimes she writes brief ideas, scenes, character sketches or responses to activities. 
- Where she writes also varies, sometimes at home, sometimes out at a cafe or a park or when travelling. The environment she writes in could be chosen to be conducive to writing or the place itself may provide material to respond to.
- She uses either a pen & paper notebook, or a tablet or a laptop to write depending on where she is and what she's writing.

Penny's needs:

- I want to be able to use an app like a notebook, so it's portable and I can just open it and start writing.

- I want an app that lets me write without distractions - no socials, no massive selection of ideas that could be overwhelming, no ads.

- I want an app that doesn't guilt me about my writing - I don't want any tracking or recording of how regularly I write. I already have a writing practice I don't want an app that puts an expectation on me.

- I want to be able to save what I write if I want. Sometimes I might just write junk and don't keep it, other times a great idea or character might come that I want to keep for later.

- I want to be able to find the entries I save again easily.

- I want to have the option to find and open a past entry and then write more on it and keep it so I can flesh out/ develop ideas in the app.

- I want the option to respond to a prompt, but I also want to be free to not use it.

- I'd like to be able to choose different types of prompts within limited, not overwhelming, choice, like writing a scene vs responding to a prompt.





### User Profile # 2
### Manu Scripsson: the professional (creative) writer


- Manu is a creative writing professional.

- He works across the cycle of a work, from ideas development to drafting and editing.

- What he writes professionally is mostly fictional prose but he does some script editing work and feature writing.

- Manu keeps a regular flow of ideas in his artistic practice, which may or may not become finished works or be integrated into other ideas.

- Part of his artistic practice is to do short writing activities that might be ideas that appear to his mind that he wants to explore or responses to prompts or his environment.

- Manu prefers to do these activities outside of the home or the workplace so that he's separated from family and work life and any routine thinking that comes with it.

- Manu mostly uses his phone or a notebook(paper) for this kind of writing, so he can fit in to diverse environments.


Manu's needs:

- I want a writing app that doesn't assume I'm not a writer. Please no courses or promises of how great my first novel will be.

- I want a writing app that isn't like my work. I already use forms and programs at work that chart scenes and chapters and plotlines etx. 

- I want an app that lets me just write in it like a notebook. 

- I want my entries to be savable so I can keep them if I want.

- I want to be able to find ideas again and develop them.

- I want to have the option of some in-built prompt or stimulator in case I dont' have anything in mind. 

- I want to be able to build out characters in a profile. So I'd be able to profile their basic information, but then also be free to write an entry related to them, so a scene or a plot point etc. I don't want it to be too ridid a form, I want some free writing included.

- I want the app to be private. I'm not saying my next idea is going to be the greatest film of all time therefore it needs hiding - but, in case it is, I'd like it to be private and not on a public wall.

- I want an app that is not collaborative or social. I collaborate and connect with other writers and editors a lot in my real life work. For me, it's just a distraction for this type of app.

- I'd like to be able to share the text. Even though I'm not looking for a social platform, it would be handy to be able to share the text from entries with others in some way, whether it's as a text message, email, airdrop or on a social media platform, so if I want to use it for work or share an idea or something, I can do that easily.


### User Profile # 3
### Paige Turner: journal-keeper who wants to write creatively

- Paige has a regular journal writing practice but doesn't write much creatively.

- Paige wants to do some creative writing but isn't sure about taking on a whole course or a large project.

- Paige has a regular day job and writes in snatches of time she finds in her day.

- Paige often writes at home on her laptop, so her journal is all in the one place but sometimes writes on the go.


Paige's needs:

- I want a creative writing app that I can also use a journal - is that a thing? Or, a journal that I can use as a creative writing app.

- I want to be able to make an entry and save it under a date, so I can keep it as a journal entry.

- I want to be able to find entries according to date again.

- I want to be able to make an entry that isn't part of the journal too. 

- I want to be able to keep my journal entries private, just like saving it on my harddrive. 

- I want to be able to access the app on more devices than my laptop so I can do journal writing or creative writing in the same online place, but be in more physical places without having to carry my laptop around.

- I want to have help getting going with creative writing, so a prompt please!

- Because I'm new to creative writing, diverse prompts would be good to try out, but nothing too heavy, I still have my journal to keep.
